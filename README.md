This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note: This was built using Node v16.19.0 - I recommend using the same version to avoid any potential issues

## Available Scripts

In the `simple-server` directory, you can run:

### `node server`

This runs the backend server which will host the fonts, images, and api for the frontend

In the `frontend` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
